# J2Cmusic
## What's this?
J2Cmusic (Japanese to Chinese on music) is a project whose goal is that translate lyric in Japanese music to Chinese version. The advantage is both singable and comprehendable, that is you can use Chinese sing a Japanese song and let people around you get your meaning at the same time without subtitles.
## Why do this?
In a website called BiliBili, you can only change a artical by 3 times. This is very inconvenient for author modify the lyric. As a result, chosing github as a website is better.
